Syrus [to AEsch. arithm] Say no more!
Let me alone to talk with him! Ι warrant
I'll make him take the money, aye, and own
That he's well treated too. [mutiny fmmord.
Why how now, Sannio'i
What's the disputa I overheard just now ’
'Twixt you and my young mastert Sca. Never was
Any dispute conducted more unfairly,
