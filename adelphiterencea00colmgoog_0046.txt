The thing concealed3 and his vows eredited.

⁴ But now, believe me, our good gentleman

Hes got a musio-girl, heav'n bless the mark!
With whom he means to live, and quit the other.
Dana And are you well assumi of thisr Heyin The mother,

The girl, tho fact itself, are all before you,

J oining to voueh the truth on’t. And besides
This Geta hore-as servants go, no bad one,
Nor given up to idleness—maintains them;

The sole support of all the family.
, Here take him, bind him, forae the truth from him.
Gelo. Ay, tortura me, if ’tis not so, good Demea!
N ay, AEschinus, I’m sure, will not deny it.
Bring me before him. Dent. [reside] I’m asham’d: and¹ what
To do, or what to say to him, I know not.
Heye'o. Yes! she now calls upon your justice, Demea!
Grant her then freely what law else will claim.
And heaven send that you may rather do
What honour bide! but if you mean it not,
Be sure of this; that with my utmost foree
I'll vindicate the girl, and her dead fathor;
He was my kinsman3 we were bred together
From children3 and our fortunes twin’d together
In war, and peace, and bitter poverty.
Wherefore I’ll try, endeavour, strive, nay lose Α
My life itself, before I will forsake them.
-What is your answerf Dent. I'll find out my brother:
What he advises I will follow, Hegio.
Heyio. But still remember, Demea, that the more
' You live at eaeo, the more your pow'r, your wealth,
Your riches, and nobility3 the more ¹
Itis your duty to aet honourably,
If you regard the name of honest men.
Dea (io to, we'll do you justine. Heye'o. ’Twill become you.
