THE BROTHERS

AoT I.-SOENE I.

Ealer M1010.

H0‚ Storax !-AEsohinus did not return

Last night irom supper; no, nor any one

Oi all tho slaves who went to see ior him.

-And what a world of iears possess me now!
How anxious that my son is not retum'd;

Lest he take oold, or fall, or break a limb!
—Gods that a man should suffer any one

To wind himself so close about his beart,

As to grow dearer to him than himself !

And yet he is not my son, but my brothers, '
Whose bent oi mind is wholly different.

I, from youth upward evon to this day,

Have led a quiet and serene town-liie3

And, as some reokon fortunate, ne'er married.
He, in all points the opposite of this,

Has pass'd his days entirely in the country

With thrift‚ and labour3 marriod; had two sons3
The elder boy is by adoption mine3

I’ve brought him up; kept3 lov’d him as my own3
Made him my joy, and all my soul holds dear,
