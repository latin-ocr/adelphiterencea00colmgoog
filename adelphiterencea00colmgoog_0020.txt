so. 11.] THE BROTHERS OF Tnunnon

Micio. But you appear uneasy. What's the matterl
Demea. Is it a question, when there's AEsohinus
To trouble us, what makes me so uneasyl
Micio. Ι said it would be so—What 1100 he donel
Demea. What 1100110 donet 0 ivretoh, whom neither ties
Oi shame, nor 1001, nor any law can bind!
For not to speak oi all his former pranks,
What 1100 he been about but even now!
Micio. What has he donel Doowo. Burst open doors, and ioro’d
His way 11110 another’s house, and beat
The master and 1110 family 11011 dead3
And carried offa girl whom 110 was fond 01.
The whole town ories out shame upon him, Micio.
Ι heve heen told oi it 0 hundred times
Since my arrival. 'Tis 1110 common talk-
And 11 we needs must draw comparisons,
Does not he see his brother, thrifty, sober,
Attentive to 1110 business in the country,
Not given to these practicesl and when
I say all 11110 10 him, to you Ι say 11.
Yon are his ruin, Micio.
Micio. Ney, nay, not so; but I will have you hear me,
Nor stun me with the seli-same thing ior ever!
Your elder son you gave me ior adoption:
He's mine then, Demea, and if 110 offends,
’Tis 011 offenoe to me, and Ι must bear
The burden Does he 110011 01 drinkl or dressl
'Tis 01 my eost, and notat yours l plead.
—Has he broke open (100101 we'll make them good.
Or 10111 0 00011 11 shall be mended. Ι,
Thank heaven, have enough to do all this,
And 'tis as yet not 1111001110-111 0 word,
I'll prove 11101 you are 111010 111 fault than Ι.
Demea. Ah, learn 10 be a father, learn from those
