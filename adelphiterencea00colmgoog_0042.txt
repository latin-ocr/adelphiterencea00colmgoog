so. nr] THE BROTHERS OF TERENOE

I've getan admirable dish of fish3

And I must take good care they are not spoilt.

For that were an offence as grievous, Demea,

In us, as 'twcrc in you to leave undeno

The things you just now mentioned: and Ι try,

According to my weak abilitics,

To teach my follow-slaves the soll-same way.

—“ This is too salt-This is burnt up too much.

That is not nice and cleanly.—That's well done.

Mind, and do so again.’'—I spare no peius,

And give them the best precepts that I cau.

In short, Ι bid them look inte the dishes,

As in a mirror, Demea, and thence learn

The duty of a coola—This school ol our's,

I own, is idle: but what can you dol

According to the man must bc the lesson.

-Would you aught else with usl Dem. Your reformation.
Syrus. Do you go henco into the countryl Dera. Straight.
Syrus. For what should you ‹lo herc, where nobody‚

However good your precepta cares to mind thcml [crit.

Danau olona.

I then will hence, since he, on whose account
I hither came, is gone into the country.

He is my only care, lcc's my concern.

My brother, since he nceds will have it sc,
May look to AEschiuus himself.—-But who
Is coming yonderl Hegio, of our tribel

Ii Ι see plainly, beyond doubt 'tis he.

I'll weit, that I may ask about his health‚
And have a little conversation with him. ·
