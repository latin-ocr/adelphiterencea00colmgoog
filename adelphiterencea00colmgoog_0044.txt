Eatcr HEGIO aad GETA ccarcrciay ul c distance.

Hcyic. Good heaven! amost unworthy action, Geta!
Geta. Ev'n so. Hcyic. A dced so base
Sprung from that family t-o AEschinus,
I’m sure this was not acting like your father.
Demea [tetiadl. So! he has heard about this music-girl,
And is affected at it, tho' a stranger,
While his good father trnly thinks it nothing.
Oh monstrous! would that he were somewhere nigh,
And heard all this! Hcyie. Unless they do what’s just,
They shall not carry off the matter thus.
Gelu. Our only hope is in you, Hegio.
You’re our sole friend, our guardian and our father,
The good old Simulus on his death-bed
Bequeath’d us to your carc. Ii you desert ne,
We are undone indeed. Heyin Ah, name it not! -
I will not, and with honesty I cannot.
Dcm. l'll go up to him-Save your: Hegio!
Hcyc'c. The man Ι look'd for-Save yon, Demea!
Dera. Your pleasure! Hcyic. AEschinuS, your elder son,
Adopted by your brother, has committed
A deed unworthy of an honest man,
And oia gentleman. Dera. How sol Hcyic. Yon knew
Our friend and good acquaintance, Simulusl
Dent. Aye sure. Heyic. There’s been a secret marriage. Dera. How!
Heyio. Hold, Demea, for the worst is still te come.
Dan Is there aught wersel Hcyic. Much worse: for this perhaps
Might be excns'd him. of his own accord
He came to the girl's mother, weeping, praying,
Entreating, vowing constancy, and swearing
That he would take her homa—He was forgiven,
