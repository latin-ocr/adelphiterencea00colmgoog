uo. 111.] THE Buornuus OF TERENCE

Supposing it sufficientior them both:
Then too you thought that I should take a wife.
Still follow the old rulo you then laid down:
Hoard‚ serape, and save3 do ev’ry thing you ean
'l'o leave them nobly! Be that glory your's.
My fortune, fall’n beyond their hopes upon them,
If they use freely, they commit no sin.
Dera. Money is not the thing: their morals— Micio. Hold!
I understand, and meant to speak of that.
There are in nature sundry marks, good Demea,
. By which you may conjecture easily,

That when two persons do the sslf-same thing,
It ostentimes falls out, that in tho one
'Tis criminal, in t’other ’tis not so z
Not that the thing itself is different,
But he who does it-In these youths Ι see
The marks of virtue, and, Ι trust, they’ll prove
Such as we wish thern. They have sense, Ι know,
Attention; in its asason, liberal shame3
And fondness for each other, all sure signs
Of an ingenuous mind and noble nature:
And though they stray, you may at any time
Reclaim thom—But perhaps you fear thay'll prove
Too inattentive to their interest.
Ο my dsar Demea, in all matters else
Increase of years increases wisdom in us:
This only vioe age brings along with it;
“ We're all more worldly-minded than there’s need : ’'
Which passion age, that kills all passions else,
Will ripen in your sons too. Daue. Have a care

’ That these fine arguments and this great mildness
Don't prove the ruin of us, Micio. Micio. Peace!
It shall not be: away with all your fearsl
This day be ruled by me: come, smooth your brow.
