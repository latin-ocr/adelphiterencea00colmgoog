se.1v.] THE BROTHERS OF Tharnen

From the old nurse, who eries, “Away, away,
Away, you have deoeiv’d us long enough,

Fool’d ue long enough with your fine promises.'’
Thus she.—“ What nowl” says I.—“Ferewell, and keep
The girl that you're so tehen with 1 ”-I saw
Immediately their cause of jaalousy:

Yet Ι contein’d myeeli, nor would disclose

My brother’s business to a tattling gossip,

By whom the knowledge on’t might be betray’d.
-But what shall Ι do nowl shall Ι confess

The girl to be my brother's; an affair

Which should by no means be reveal'd l—But not
To dwell on that—Perhaps they’d not disclose it.
Nay, Ι much doubt if they would eredit it:

So many proois concur against myseh—

Ι bore her off : I paid the money down3

She was brought home to me-All this, Ι own,
Ie my own fault For should I not heve told
My father, be it es it might, the wholel

Ι should, I doubt not, have obtain’d his leave

To marry Pamphila—What indolence

Ev'n till this hour! Now, AEschinus, awake!
—But first l'll go, and clear myeeli to them.

I'll to the door [goes up} confusion! how Ι tremble!
How guilty-like I seem, when Iapproeeh

This house! [hurle] Hola! within! 'Tis13

'Tis AEsohinus. Come, open somebody

The door immediately !—Who’s herel A stranger!

I'll step aeide. [retines.
