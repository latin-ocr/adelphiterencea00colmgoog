Syrna The girl, he says, was bought hy my advice.
Dem. Did you not say you saw him out of town
A little while ago! Synna And so I did.
But he earne back soon after, like a madman.
He had no marey-Was he not asham'd
To beat a poor old fellow! to beat me;
Who bore him in my arms but t'other day,
An urohin thus high! [showing] Dent. Oh rare, Ctesipho!
Father's own son! 6 man, I warrant him.
Syrna Oh rare, d'ye cry! I'faith, il he is wise
He'll hold his hands another time. Dela. Oh bravo !
Syron Oh mighty bravo, indeed! Because hebeat ,
A helpless girl, and me a wretched slave,
Who durst not strike again ;—oh, to be sure,
Mighty bravo, truly! Dela. Oh, most exquisite!
My Ctesipho peroeived, as well as I,
That you were the contriver of this business.

-But is my brother here! Syrna Not he [aalka'ly] Dera. I'm thinking ⁸

But I'll not tell. Dana How, sirrah! Syma Even so.
Dent. I’ll break your head Syrus. I cannot tell the name
Of him he’s gone to, but I know the place.
Dana. Well‚ where’s the place! Syma D'ye know the Portieo
Just by the market, down this way! [pointing] Dent. I do.
Syrna Oo up that street; keep straight along: and then
You'll see 6 hill; go straight down that: and then
On this hand there's 6 chapel; and just by,
A narrow lane [pointing] Dola. Where! [laelling] Syrus⁸ There!
