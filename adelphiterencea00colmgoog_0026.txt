So you might do a kindness to my master!
—Besides they say you're setting out lor Cyprus, [carelessly.
Suo. Ha! [claimed] Syrus. And have bought upa large stock of
goods
To carry over thither.--Hir'd a vessel.
That 'tis, I know, which keeps you in suspense:
When you return, Ι hope, you'll settle this.
Suo. I shall not budge a scot—Undone, by heav'n!
Urg'd by these hopes they've undertaken this. [oside.
Syrus. Hc leurs I've thrown a small rub in his way.
So, so ! ho yields at last, this wretched trador. [cade.
-Ι have but one word more to say to you:
See, how you like it—Rathor, Sannio,
Thau run the risk to get or lose the whole,
E'en halve the matterr and he shall contrive
To serape together by some means ten minae.
Soa. Ales, alas! am I in danger then
· Of losing ev’n my very principall
Shame on him; hohas loosen'd all my teeth:
Aud will he cheat me too l-I’m going nowhere.
Syrtes. Just as you pleasa-Have you ought else to say
Before I gol Sua. Yes, one word, prithee Syrus!
Howover things have happen’d, rather than
I should be driven to commoneo a suit,
Lct him return me my bare due at least;
The sum she eost me, Syrus-I'm convinc'd
You've had no tokens ol my friendship yet;
But you shall find I will not be ungrateful.
Syrus. I'll do my best. But I see Ctesipho.
He is rejoic'd about his mistress. Soc. Say, [cellro.
Will you remember mol Syrus. Hold, holdalittle! [Syrus aad Sua.
