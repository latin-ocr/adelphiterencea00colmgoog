6616] THE BROTHERS OF TERENGE

Striving to make myself as deur to him.

I give, o'erlook, nor think it requisito

That all his deeds should be controll'd by me,
Giving him scope to aet 66 of himself,

So that the prenks 61 youth, which other children
Hide from their fathers, I heve us'd my son
Not to conceal from me. For whosoe'er
Hath wcn upon himself to play the false one,
¹And practise impositione on a father,

Will do the same with 1666 remorse to othe1s3
And 'tis in my opinion better far .

To bind your children to you by the ties

Ol gentleness and modesty, than leur.

And yet my brother don't accord in this, 5¹ ‘¹‘ 7
Nor do these notione, nor this conduct please him.
Oft he comes open-mouth'd—Why how now, Miciol

Why do you ruin this young lad oi oursl

Why does he playl why drinkl and why do you
Allow him money to afford all thiel

You let him dress 166 fine 'Tis idle in you.

-—'Tis hard in him, unjust and cut ol reason

And he, I think, deceives himself indeed,

Who fancies that authority more firm

Founded on force, than what is built on iriendship;
But here is the man, whom I was speaking oi.

He seems uncasy too, l know not why,

And I suppose, as usual, comesto wrangle.

SOENE ΙΙ.
Eater Duum.

Micio. Demea, I’m glad tc 666 you well Demea. Oho!
Well met: the very man I came tc seek.
