sc. m] THa BROTHERS OF TERENOE

Can. Troth as the case stands, medam, circumstances
Oculd not have happen’d better than they havc:
And since your daughter married secretly,
’Twas well shc met with such a man as this,
7 A man of honour, rank, and family.
Sos. Hc ia, indeed, a worthy gentleman:
The gods preserve him to us!

SCENE ΙΙ.

Geta. We are now
So absolutely lost, that all the world
J oining in consultation to apply ⁸
Relief to the misfortune that has fallen
On me, my mistress, and her daughter, all
’ Would not avail. Oh, what an age is this!
Oh wiched, oh vilc race l-oh impious man l
Sos. [to Canthara] Ah, why should Geta seem thus terrified
And agitatedl Geta [lo himself} Wretch! whom neither honour,
N or catha, nor pity could control or move!
Soa. I don’t well understand him. Oea. Prithee then
Let us draw ucarer, Sostrata! Geta [to lcimcclfl. Ales,
I’m scarcely in my perfect mind, I burn
In such fiercc anger-Oh, that I had all
That villain-family before mc now,
First Γᾶ tread out the stinking snuff his father,
Who gave the monster being-And then, Syrus,
Who urg’d him to it,—how Γᾶ lash him l-Next
Γᾶ tear the lovcr's eyes out, tumble him,
Hcad iorcmost, down some precipice-the rest
Γᾶ rush on, drag, crush, trample under foot.
But why do I delay to tell my mistress
This heavy news as soon as possiblel [yoc'wy.
