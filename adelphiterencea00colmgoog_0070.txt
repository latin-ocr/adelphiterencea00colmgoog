SOENE III.

Eotor Mroro soon Sosrnnrn.

Micio [lo Sostrata scithia} All is prepar’d: and we are ready, Sostrata,
As Ι have already told you, when you please. [amos forword.

But who's this iorces open our streetdoor
With so much violence?

Eatcr Dolona oa toa other side.

Deos. confusion! death!
What shall Ι dol or how resolvel where vent
My ories and exclamatione on this businessl
Micio [lettard. So! all's discover'd: that’s the thing he ravos at.
-Now for a quarrell Ι must help the boy. .
Deos. [saloy ota} Oh, there’s the grand corruptor of our children!
Micio. Appease your wrath, and he yoursclf again;
Deos„ Well, l’ve appeas'd it 3 I'm myself again3
Ι spara reproaches3 let us to the the point!
It was agreed between us, and it was
Your own proposal too, that you should never
concern yourself with Ctesipho, nor Ι
With AEschinus. Say, was't not sol Micio. It was.
Ι don't deny it. Deos. Why does Ctesipho
Revel with you thenl Why do you receive himl
Since Ι do not concern myself with your’s,
Meddle not you with minat Micio. This is not fair3
Indeed it is not. Think on the old saying,
“All things are common among friends” Dom. How smart!
Put off with puffs and sentences at last Ι
Micio. Nay, hear mo, if you can have patience, Demea
-First, if you're grier’d at their extravagance,
Let this reflection calm you! Formerly
You brad them both according to your fortune,
