Who know what 'tis to he indeed a parent!
Micio. By nature you're his father, Ι by eounsel.
Demea. You! do you oounsel any thingl Micio. Nay, nay;

ΙΙ you persist I'm gone. Demea Is’t thus you treat mel
Micio. Musti still hear the something o’er and o'erl
Demea It touohes me. Micio. And me it touches too.

But, Demea, let us each look to our own:

Let me take earo of one, and mind you t'other;

For to concern yourself with both, appears

As if you'd redamand the hoy you gave.
Demea. You wish I should take care of one. Ido

Take special aare of him; and he, thank heav'n,

Is as I wish he should be: which your ward, Ι

Ι warrant, shall find out one time or other.

I will not sayought worse ol him at present. [eall.
Micio. Though what he says be not entirely true,

There's something iu it and it touches me.

But I dissembled my eonoern with him,

Because the nature of the man is suoh,

To paoify, I must oppose and thwart him 3

And even thus Ι scarae oen teaeh him patience.

But were Ι to inflame or aid his anger,

I were as great a madman as himself„

Yet AEsehinus‚ 'tis true, has heen to blame

He told me he proposed to take a wife. ¹

I hop'd the hey-day of the blood was over,

And was rejoio'd: but his intemperanee

Breaks out afresh—-Well, be it what it may,

I'll find him out, and know it instantly,

If he is to be met with at the Forum.
