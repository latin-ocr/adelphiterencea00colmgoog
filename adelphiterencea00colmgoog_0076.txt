Smiling on ull; a iovial buchclor,

Hie whole expcnces center'd in himself.

I on the contrary, rough‚ rigid, croee,

Suring, morose, and thrifty, took e wife:
-Whet miseriei did marriage bring l-hud childrcn3
-A new uncasineee l-cnd then besides,
Striving cll ways 10 make a fortune ior them,
Iheve worn out my primo oi liic und heulth:
And now, my course near finish'd, what retum
Dc I receive for all my 10111 Thcir hate.
Meanwhile my brother, without any cure,
Recpe cll e iether's comforte. Him thoy love,
Me'they avoid: 10 him they open all

Their secret counsels5 doct on him; and both
Repcir to him; while I em quite forsuken.

His life they pray ior, but expect my death.
Thus those, brought up by my cxceeding labour,
Hc, et e small expcnce, hes made his own:
The cere cll minc, end all the plcceure his.
-'-Well then, let me endeavour in my turn

To tecch my tongue civility, to give

With open-hended generosity‚

Since Ι em challeng'd to’t l-und let me 100
Obtein the love end reverence of my children!
And if 'tie bought by bounty und indulgence,
I will not be behind-hand-Cush will 1011 :
Whut's thot 10 me, who em thc cldest borni
