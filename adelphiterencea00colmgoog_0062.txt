And am asham'd to 000 you! Micio. Ι believe it;
For well I know you have a liberal mind:
But I'm afraid you are too negligent,
You took too small precaution Nor consider'd
What should be done, or how. l would not have you
Thus negligent in other matters—Come,
Gheer up, eon! you shall keep her. AEseh. How! Micio. Oheer up,
l say! AEseh. Nay‚ prithee, do not moelr me, father!
Micio. Moclr yout I'l wherefore'l AEseh. Idon't know, unless
That l so mueh desire it may be true,
I therefore fear it more. Micio. —Away3 go home3
And pray the Geds‚ that you may eall your wife.
Away! AEseh. Nay you, sir, rather pray the Gods;
For, being a mueh better man than I,
They will the sooner hear your pray're. Micio. I'll in,
Το 000 the needful preparatione made.
You, if you're wise, do as I said.

AEsemuus alea.

I’m tir'd with walhing.-Jove eonfound you, Syrus
You and your blind directions! Ihave erawl'd
All the town over: to the gate; the pond;
Where 11011 No sign of any shop was there,
Nor any person who had seen my brother.
-Now I'll in therefore, and 001 up my rest
In his own house, till he eomes home again.
