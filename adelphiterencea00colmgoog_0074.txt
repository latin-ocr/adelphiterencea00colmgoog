Dent. Well, since at present things are so, Ι must;
But then I'll to the country with my son
To-morrow, at first peep of day. Micio. At midnight,
So you'll but smile to-day. Dona And that girl too
I'll drag away with me. Micia Aye3 there you've hit it.
For by that means you’ll keep your son at home;
Do but secure her. Dent. I’ll see that: forthere
I’ll put hor in the kitohen and the mill,
And make her full of ashes, smoke‚ and meal:
N ay at high noon too she shall gather stubblo.
I’ll burn her up, and make her blaolr as ooal.

Micio. Ah! now your wiso, that's only right and fair.

Dera. D'ye laugh at mel how happy in your temper!
Ifeel— Micio. Ah! that againl' Dent. I'vodono. Micio. In then!
And let us suit our humour to the time. [emittat.

SOENE IV.
DEMnA olona

Nover did man lay down so fair a plan,

So wiso a rulo oi life, but fortune, age,

Or long experienoe made some change in it 3
And taught him, that those things he thought he knew
He did not know, and what he held aa best,
In practice he threw by. The very thing
That happens to myself. For that hard life
Which I have ever led, my raoe near run,
Now in the last stage I renounoe: and whyl
But that by dear experiente I’ve been told,
There's nothing so advantages a man

As mildness and complacenoy. Of this

My brother and myself are living proofs:
He always led an easy, cheorlul liie;

Good humour’d‚ mild, offending nobody,
